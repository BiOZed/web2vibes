# web2vibes
An attempt to apply Web Development tools and workflow to musical composition.

## Philosophy
* `build` folder for composition projects and `src` folder for everything related to learning resources or musical ideas.
* Using Version Control when learning and creating pieces of music.
* Following Modular and D.R.Y. approaches.

## Last Updates
### August 7th 2016:
* First commits.
* Basic structure for Core
* Some first conventions are appearing, try to keep it consistent.

#### Notes:
It probably makes sense to keep on working mainly on the 3 Core Concepts already defined, and not to get lost in larger scope.
