# web2vibes
An attempt to apply Web Development tools and workflow to musical composition.

## Philosophy
* `build` folder for composition projects and `src` folder for everything related to learning resources and musical ideas.
* Using Version Control when learning and creating pieces of music.
* Following Modular and D.R.Y. approaches.

## Last Updates
### August 9th 2016
* Added PDF about pitch
* Learned more about organisations of pitch on a keyboard.
* Question about structure (Music Notation vs Music Theory)

### August 8th 2016
* Re-organized Core folder
* Added Music Theory Resources
* Extracted images in `static` folder
* Added Core/Intervals folder (empty)
* Added Core/Pitches with first content

#### Notes
Looks like it's mainly about Theory and Resources for the moment.
Really nice resources. Well-diversified forms.
Keep working on Pitches. Cross-verify knowledge with all resources.

### August 7th 2016:
* First commits.
* Basic structure for Core
* Some first conventions are appearing, try to keep it consistent.

#### Notes:
It probably makes sense to keep on working mainly on the 3 Core Concepts already defined, and not to get lost in larger scope.
