# `src/Core/Scales`

## Definition
* A Scale is a collection of notes.
* A Scale is defined by a root note (Key) and a collection of Tones and SemiTones.

### Scale Degrees
A Scale Degree is basically the note at a specific index of the scale.

Each Degree as a specific name:
* 1 - Tonic
* 2 - Supertonic
* 3 - Mediant
* 4 - Subdominant
* 5 - Dominant
* 6 - Submediant
* 7 - Leading Note

## Next steps
* Conceive a workflow concept on how to define that a scale can be switched from `learning` to `learn`.
