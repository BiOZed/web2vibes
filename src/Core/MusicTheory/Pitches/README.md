# `src/Core/MusicTheory/Pitches`

## Definition

From daveconservatoire.org
* All sounds are created when an object vibrates and the pitch of a sound depends on the pitch of this vibration. The faster the vibration the higher in pitch the sound.
* An `Hertz` is a vibration per second. Pitches can be defined by telling on many times they vibrate per second.
* If we double the speed of vibration (or frequency) of a sound, the two pitches will sound similar and will blend together well. This special relationship is known as an octave.

http://tobyrush.com/theorypages/pdf/0102pitchnotation.pdf is a really great resource for understanding easily what a pitch is, and how it's noted on paper.

### Organisation on the piano
Still from daveconservatoire.org :

### Distance between notes
* To measure these distances we can talk about tones and semitones. On a keyboard instrument like a piano or organ each of the keys is one semitone apart.

### Ear Training
daveconservatoire has ear training module. Managed to spot if two notes where an octave away from each others + simple pitches differences (some troubles with bass notes).

## Questions
* How did this naming system appeared ? Do-ré-mi VS C-D-E history ? --> https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_de_la_notation_musicale
* Why not having a single name for each note ? --> http://www.easyzic.com/dossiers/la-gamme-de-pythagore,h151.html?nocache=1471790429 (not read yet, would like to learn more about intervals)
