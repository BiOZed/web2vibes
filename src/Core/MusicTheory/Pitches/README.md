## Definition

From daveconservatoire.org
* All sounds are created when an object vibrates and the pitch of a sound depends on the pitch of this vibration. The faster the vibration the higher in pitch the sound.
* An `Hertz` is a vibration per second. Pitches can be defined by telling on many times they vibrate per second.
* If we double the speed of vibration (or frequency) of a sound, the two pitches will sound similar and will blend together well. This special relationship is known as an octave.

http://tobyrush.com/theorypages/pdf/0102pitchnotation.pdf is a really great resource for understanding easily what a pitch is, and how it's noted on paper.
