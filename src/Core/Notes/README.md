# `src/Core/Notes`

## What should be in there ?

* A folder for each Musical Note.

## Next Steps

* Add Sound files for each Note.
* Create `knowledge` folder, where historical background, mathematical / physics explanations written by myself can be found.

## Open questions
* Would it make sense to try to define note attributes in each Note README ?
* Should I give both names of sharp/flat notes ?

## Done
* Create folders.
