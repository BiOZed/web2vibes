# `src/Core/Scales`

## What should be in there ?

* Two folders: `learned` and `learning`.

## Next steps

* Create folders
* Conceive a workflow concept on how to define that a chord can be switched from `learning` to `learn`. (Should probably be the same as Core/Scales)
* Define sub_folders structure (by root note ? by chord type ? by genre ?) (do some research)
