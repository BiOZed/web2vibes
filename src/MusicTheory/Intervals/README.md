## Definition
* An interval is a special relationship between two notes.
* All the different interval names (in English), relate to the count of letter names (or white notes on a keyboard) that you must cross from the two notes.

## Interval Names (Examples based on C)
* From C to C --> C D E F G A B C = 8 notes = Octave
* From C to G --> C D E F G = 5 notes = Fifth
* From C to F --> C D E F = 4 notes = Fourth
* From C to E --> C D E = 3 notes = Third
* From C to D --> C D = 2 notes = Second
* From C to A --> C D E G A = 6 notes = Sixth
* From C to B --> C D E G A B= 7 notes = Seventh

## The different forms of the Fifth Interval
* There are three forms defined by the count of Semi-Tones between the two notes.
* Perfect Fifth = 7 Semi Tones --> C to G
* Diminished Fifth = 6 Semi Tones --> C to Gb
* Augmented Fifth = 7 Semi Tones --> C to G#

It is important to remember that for writing the flats and sharps, we have to remember the count of letter names. C to Gb is a Fifth, C to F# is a Fourth, even though it's the same notes.

## The different forms of the Fourth Interval
* Perfect Fourth = 5 Semi Tones --> C to F
* Diminished Fourth = 4 Semi Tones --> C# to F
* Augmented Fourth = 6 Semi Tones --> Cb to F

## The different forms of the Third Interval
* Major Third = 4 Semi Tones --> C to E
* Minor Third = 3 Semi Tones --> A to C

Interesting : When we talk of the Major/Minor Scale, we talk about the number of Semi Tones between the Tonic and the Third.

## The different forms of the Second Interval
* Major Second = 2 Semi Tones --> C to D
* Minor Second = 1 Semi Tones --> B to C

## The different forms of the Sixth Interval
* Major Sixth = 9 Semi Tones --> C to A
* Minor Sixth = 8 Semi Tones --> A to F

## The different forms of the Seventh Interval
* Major Seventh = 11 Semi Tones --> C to B
* Minor Seventh = 10 Semi Tones --> C to Bb
